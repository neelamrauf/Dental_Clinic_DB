Dental Clinic Management System
Project Overview
The Dental Clinic Management System is designed to streamline the management of dental treatments that require multiple visits, such as root canals. 
This system aims to enhance patient care by efficiently tracking treatment procedures, equipment usage, and patient follow-ups. The project is developed as part of a Database Management System (DBMS) course under the guidance of Professor Sehrish Khan.

Key Features:
